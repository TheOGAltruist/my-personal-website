                I currently work as a Principal Engineer, Digital Workplace for the Most Sustainable Company in the
                World - Schneider Electric. I design, implement, manage and improve all automation solutions within
                Digital
                Workplace. I'm also the Technical Lead for all things email. I work with Solution Architects to plan and
                design Messaging solutions (primarily focused on email). I work with Global Operation teams to deploy
                and
                manage those solutions. I mentor my teammates, by primarily focusing on the basics, to ensure that they
                have
                a
                solid foundational understanding of the products and technologies that we use on a daily basis. I have
                always worked only on the Microsoft Solution stack and products that they integrate with.

                I love building solutions to make lives easier for those that use or govern Microsoft 365 for
                Enterprise.
                With that goal, I've recently embarked on a journey to unlock and enhance my solution building skills by
                learning Web Development.
